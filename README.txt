Printing
=========
To print, type "print" (in lowercase) in the line you want.
And In the line after that write what you want to print.

Inputs
=========
To input, type "inp" (in lowercase) in the line you want.
And In the line after that write what you want to be in the input.
For Example:

inp
username

That Would be compiled to "username $ " With the input box after that.
Note that after an input is entered, it will print it.

Math Inputs
=========
Math inputs are basically inputs, but with math.
if you type 'minpp', it will compile into 2 inputs: First / Second.
Then, after the 2 inputs her set, It will add them up.
There are more minp combinations: minpm (minus), minpmu (multiply), minpd (divide).

Smart Inputs
=========
Smart Inputs (sminp) are basically Math Inputs, But with only 1 input. The Second input is set in the next line of the code.
For Example:

sminpp
200

If the first input the user gives is "100", then it will print 300.
Other Combinations of Smart Inputs: sminpm (minus), sminpmu (multiply), minpd (divide)

Saving Variables
=========
NOTE: You cant save variables & read variables in the same script, cause is unknown yet.

If you type 'svb', it will compile and save a variable with the name of it being the next line of the code, and the data inside of it being the next-next line of the code.
For Example:

svb
myVariable
Hello World

This will compile into saving a variable named 'myVariable' with the text 'Hello World' Inside of it.

Reading Variables
=========
NOTE: You cant save variables & read variables in the same script, cause is unknown yet.

If you type 'rvb', it will compile into reading a variable with the name of it being the next line of the code.
For Example:

rvb
myVariable

This will compile into reading a variable named 'myVariable'.
